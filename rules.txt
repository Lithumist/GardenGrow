Due to an abstraction leak I have to make sure that none of the rules are affected by the order in which I place tiles...



1) If a tier X cell has exactly 2 water tiles as it's neighbour then it turns into the next generation.

2) If a tree cell has the right conditions to move up a tier, instead of spawning the next tier, it turns into a seed.

3) If a water cell has 0 water neighbours then it dies.

4) If a cell has between 3-7 water tiles as it's neighbour, then it dies.

5) If a cell has 8 water tiles as it's neighbour, then it turns into a water tile,

TODO -> Need another rule to remove water tiles.
