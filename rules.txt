Due to an abstraction leak I have to make sure that none of the rules are affected by the order in which I place tiles...



1) If a tier X cell has exactly 2 water tiles as it's neighbour then it turns into the next generation.

2) If a tree cell has the right conditions to move up a tier, instead of spawning the next tier, it turns into a seed.

3) If a water cell has 0 water neighbours then it dies.

4) If a cell has between 3-7 water tiles as it's neighbour, then it dies.

5) If a cell has 8 water tiles as it's neighbour, then it turns into a water tile,



Improvements needed:

1) Need a way to 'use up' water tiles

2) Need a system of movement.

3) Need to alter tier upgrading to prevent constant cycling.


Idea that addresses #1 and #3:
When trees can upgrade, instead of turning back into a seed, they change the two water tiles adjacent to them into seeds

Also, maybe tiered cells need to die if they have 0 water neighbours then it should die?
